## Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us understand datasets through visualization and statistics.  
We used the YouTube Data API v3 to collect video information and analyze trends across different topics.

### Research Questions & Hypotheses

1. **Do music videos get higher view counts than educational videos?**  
   *Hypothesis:* Classical music videos have higher average view counts than math tutorials.  
   *Result:* Failed to reject the null hypothesis, no significant difference.

2. **Are fitness videos getting higher like counts than vlogging videos?**  
   *Hypothesis:* Travel vlogs receive higher average like counts than Pilates fitness videos.  
   *Result:* Reject the null, we have enough evidence to support the hypothesis

3. **Does upload timing affect the number of likes a video receives?**  
   *Hypothesis:* Videos uploaded on weekends get more likes than weekday uploads.  
   *Result:* Failed to reject the null hypothesis, no significant difference.
